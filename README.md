Project title: Smart Data Deduplication System. 

Project Description: The Smart Data Deduplication System is designed to identify duplicate data and keep only unique records in the database. Cloud storage systems store a large amount of data from multiple users, which often leads to the storage of duplicate files. These duplicate files increase storage cost, waste memory, and reduce system efficiency. To address this problem, this project proposes a Smart Data Deduplication System that detects and eliminates redundant data before storing it in the database. The project first implements a traditional deduplication technique and then extends it with metadata-based and adaptive strategies, allowing performance comparison and analysis.

Tech Stack: CSS, HTML, Python, MySQL
